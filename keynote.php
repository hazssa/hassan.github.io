		<em><p>SAUVE; The redeemer of forgetfulness</p>
<p>Khalilat Ibrahim Titilope.</p>


<p>You forget people's names. you will try to justify what the reason is, but checking out to find out, proved abortive as one cause you thought of fades away as soon as another cause appears. </p>
<p>
Have you ever been in this dilemma?</p>

<p>You will find out here, but I want you to do one thing.
If you are ready to find out why you forget people's names and ways to overcome this, get your mind prepared.

And if you are not, you may go do whatever you want to do.

If you're still here, you are about to hit a jackpot of worthwhile knowing that you will be grateful for.

You don't remember people's names often.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why?</p>

<p> it is a SIX SECONDS SYNDROME(sss).

After someone mentioned his or her name to you.

You need to do something about it at that moment. else, you end up forgetting even while you are in a conversation with them.

That is when you find yourself saying "can you remind me of your name again?"

And when you forget people's names, it sends a signal to them. </p>

And that's what?<br>

It could mean you care less about them.

Or show you have a bad memory.

And the truth is, there is zero BAD and GOOD MEMORY.

What we have is a TRAINED and UNTRAINED MEMORY.

Our mind(brain) is set to perform whatever task we give it to execute.</p>

<p>A lot of us remember people's faces but not their names.

But rarely occurs vice versa on a stable mind(remembering their name but not the face). That's absurd, right?

When someone calls you by your name even for the first time you meet or after a long time you've seen.

It makes you glitter with the thought "waw! he remembered my name, waw! she Knows my name".

That's because "people don't care about what you know but how much you care to know about them".</p>

<p>This demonstrates what Jim Kwik said;</p>
<em>
"People will forget what you say,
People will forget what you do,
But will always remember how you make them feel."
</em>
<p>Remembrance of people's names is a unique business etiquette and networking skill.

Which illustrates the fact that it's not a matter of who you know but who knows you.</p>

<em>Because why?<br></em>

<i>When you remember practically most people you were together in a conference room or a congregation(for example).

It makes you stand out among them and gives you an expanse in the society at large thereby retaining people's attention to you.
<br>
You will wonder if it is possible.

Yes, it is. depending on how well you train your MIND.</i>
<p/>
Make sense?
You may go back to read it again

Now, You will want to ask me.
And how can this be overcome?
How do I gain this Unique etiquette of remembrance in networking?

If you want me to share, then here is where your chair should be drawn closer if you are far from me.

And I will share. Moreover, my concern is your wellness.

The power of promise can never be overemphasized.

Those who understand promise will always keep to It one way or the other.

If a busy schedule has been the reason for not fulfilling your promise, have it written down(to-do list), or better still ask those you promise to always remind you.

I promise to share the Unique etiquette of remembrance in networking 

Here it is;

<p><i>Remembrance of people's names amidst lots of people you've met or will be meeting is the ability of you not to mix one person's name for another.

The truth is, it's not difficult at all. It only requires a procedure. 

Here is where your concentration should be doubled.

Because why?

The explanation will be intense yet simple.

Gotten a chair?

Good.</p></i>

<p>When you see someone and you introduce yourself to one another.
  
The very first thing you do is;

SAY: say the person's name again to see if you pronounce the name as the bearer has done it. And that moment your mind(brain) holds it.

ASK: here you want to be sure you hear them correctly. so you ask.

</P>example: 
<ul>
<li>1st speaker: "Hi, I'm Blossom."</li>
 <li> 2nd speaker:Hello, Blossom.</li>

<li>1st speaker:Yes, And you're? </li>
<br>
<em>You can do well to ask what brought about the name she bears or who she was named after.

This gives your mind a clear understanding of the name.

Get it?

Give me üñê.

Another thing you want to do as soon as there is a chance for more conversation is;

USE: here you only want to use the name in the conversation not misuse or abuse the name.

For example;</em></br>

<li>2nd speaker: Blossom, you mentioned going through a hectic jam on your way here, hope you aren't weary.</li>
</ul>
<p>After her acknowledgment, you need not repeat her name in the next statement.
That's misuse and abuse which is absurd.</p>

Try it right now and hear how you just sounded. Not pleasant, right?

Exactly.

<p>There is no need to repeat the name, again and again, you may only use the name thrice or 4 times depending on how long the conversation is.

The next you will not want to miss is this;</p>

<p>VISUALIZE:when you heard someone say their name, you give a mental picture of the name;</p>

<p>Example:</P> when you hear the name "Blossom", the mental picture you may have could be a beautiful birthed flower and that will keep you reminded of the person and the name.

Lovely, right?

<p>END:</p><br> at this point, you want to put an end to the scenario by assuming you have no conversation in the first instance.

Here, if you have no opportunity to ask/use their name while conversing with them.</br><p> SAYING the name and VISUALISING(mental picture)  it in your mind will keep the name in your memory.

Have you deduced the acronyms of these tips?<p/>
<ul>
See it here;
SUAVE.
<li>S-say</li>
<li>U-use</li>
<li>A-ask</li>
<li>V-visualise</li>
<li>E-end.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must have been using this without you realizing this is the process.

Thank God you now know.
</p>
<em>If you have no idea about it, take note and begin to practice.

And If you have been practicing this unknowingly, be more intentional about it now.
<br>
This aids your mental health.
<br>
Remember, your wellness is my interest.</em>

           <h2>Islamic standards</h2>
      <p>I've no hard feelings towards you, My heart is pure.</p>

<p>My friend, How true is that?

................</p>

<br>Purity is a state of being pure.</br>

<p>Purification (Taharah) in Islam however emphasized cleanliness internally and externally.</p>

<br>That is physical cleanliness and spiritual cleanliness.</br>

<br>Physical cleanliness involves the practice of personal hygiene, e.g. substance you consume, clothes you wear, etc.</br>

<br>In Islam, ablution(wudu) is a physical form of cleanliness as well as the Ritual baths(Ghusul).</p>

<em>The bath you perform after monthly Menstruation (Ghusul hydol), after sexual intercourse or ejaculation(Ghusl Janabah), and after the end of bleeding of a newborn mother(Ghusul Nifas) which may take 6 months.

Before returning to salat (prayer) these categories of people are expected to be pure by performing this bath(Ghusl) before Ablution(wudu). 

In addition to these baths are (Ghusul Janazah) a bath for the dead, and( Dhukul Fi Islam) for someone about to embrace Islam.

And for inner purity which is spiritual cleanliness.</em></p>

<em>It requires you to be pure at heart(Qalib), and have no grudge or hate to fellow humans. and involve you not being a part of backbite, slander, and every illicit act that could reduce or shatter your connection with Allah.

Physical and spiritual purity is however essential for every Muslim or believer who does not want to be found worshipping Allah(God) in vain.

May our effort never be in vain.</em></p>

Take your time to reflect.<br>

I hope you find value.</br>

           <h2>physical health</h2>
      <p>Most of the time, you set an alarm for you to go to sleep and for you to be awake.</p>

<p>Even though very few set alarms for bedtime.

While the majority set alarms for waking up.

What if I tell you that you don't even need an alarm to sleep or wake up?

Why?</p>

<em>Your body already possesses a scientific alarm which is "Carcadium Rythm".

As long as no one steps out of time or
tune, you stay asleep.</em></p>

<em>Sleep occurs when two instruments connect with it each other in the brain.<br>

 When the instruments are out of kilter, your sleep may not be restful. <br>

When this problem persists, you say you have a sleep disorder.<br>

Which affects your physical and mental health. Causing you an unusual reaction you can't explain.<br>

And the question becomes;</em></p>
 what exactly is sleep?<br>

Is it a state of complete shutdown?<br>

Is it a state of rest?<br>

Is it a state of unconsciousness? <br>

<p>Join me this evening here on Facebook where I will be sharing what, why, and how sleep is noteworthy for you.

Vahrashee Ishaku Noah will be hosting me @ the series; Health Talk with the Leadership Physician.<br>

8:00 pm,  Nigeria time.</p>
