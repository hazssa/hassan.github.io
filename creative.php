		<em>"Let’s take a young man named Ade as a case study. Ade just got an opportunity to write for an influential man who owns an organization.
		This young man has written for people majorly as a volunteer severally without being bothered about fees even when he doesn’t feel too well.
		P0 and 00<br>
		Getting this opportunity to work for this man excited him so much that he wished to begin the work immediately and still cared less about being paid.<br>
		Here his passion for his writing talent and mastery kept him going till he finally hit the jackpot he wasn’t expecting.his effort(passion) was worth it.<br>
		</p>
		Here I would clearly state that the password to survival is passion.<br>
		</p>
		The energy you give into something you enjoy and believe in even if the outcome isn’t immediate, even at the point at which people criticize or make a fool out of you just because you chose to stick to the end.
Yet, you chose to be happy because you didn’t choose what people will be happy about.
 You rather choose what you wish to help people get ecstatic about on your terms, which is the best decision you can ever make to survive all odds.<br>
 In your thought, won’t she share with me how best to do this? You must be having this in your mind already. 
 I’m sure to save you the stress of curiosity."</em><br>
		<em>forgotten through the lives you've librated?</em>

		HOW TO MAKE PASSION THE PASSWORD TO SURVIVAL.
		</p>
		<em>Identify what you truly enjoy doing:<br>
		What is that creativity you have an interest in? <br>
		Every work or job involves creativity. you need to answer the question truthfully. you can choose to ask people around you, who will be sincere with you about how well you’ve done on the path or will be doing as regards your commitment level.
			
			Ask yourself if it’s what people can benefit positively from I would always say, In all, you choose to do, make sure you are helping people.<br>
			If it’s sewing, for example, you should be sure you want to help people look elegant."</p></em>
